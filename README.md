# TUI Test

TUI Test is a framework for testing terminal applications. It provides a rich API for writing tests that interact with a terminal application across macOS, Linux, and Windows with a wide range of shells. It is built to be **fast**, **reliable**, and **easy to use**.

## Installation

Install TUI Test as using `npm`:

```sh
npm i -D @microsoft/tui-test
```

or `yarn`

```sh
yarn add --dev @microsoft/tui-test
```

or `pnpm`

```sh
pnpm add -D @microsoft/tui-test
```

## Running Tests

Running tests is as simple as running TUI Test from the command line after installation:

```sh
tui-test
```

Or run it using `npx`:

```sh
npx @microsoft/tui-test
```


## Capabilities

### Resilient • No flaky tests

**Auto-wait** TUI Test provides a rich API for interacting with the terminal. It waits for the terminal to be ready before executing commands, and it provides tooling for waiting for terminal renders before executing assertions.

**Tracing**. Configure test retry strategy, capture stdout & stderr, and create detailed terminal snapshots to eliminate flakes.

### Full isolation • Fast execution

**Terminal contexts**. TUI Test creates a new 'terminal context' for each test, which includes a new terminal and new underlying pty. This delivers full test isolation with zero overhead. Creating new terminal contexts only takes a handful of milliseconds.

### Multi-platform / Multi-shell • No more "it works in my shell"

**Multi-platform**. TUI Test supports testing on macOS, Linux, and Windows with a wide range of shells when installed: `cmd`, `windows powershell`, `powershell`, `bash`, `git-bash`, `fish`, `zsh`, and `xonsh`.

**Wide-support**. TUI Test uses [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) to render the terminal, which is a widely used terminal emulator in projects like [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) and [Hyper](https://github.com/vercel/hyper).

## Examples

### Terminal Program

This code snippet shows how to start the terminal with a specific program running.

```ts
import { test, expect } from "@microsoft/tui-test";

test.use({ program: { file: "git" } });

test("git shows usage message", async ({ terminal }) => {
  await expect(terminal.getByText("usage: git", { full: true })).toBeVisible();
});
```

### Terminal Screenshot

This code snippet shows how to take a screenshot of the terminal.

```ts
import { test, expect } from "@microsoft/tui-test";

test("take a screenshot", async ({ terminal }) => {
  terminal.write("foo")

  await expect(terminal.getByText("foo")).toBeVisible();
  await expect(terminal).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

### Terminal Assertions

This code snippet shows how to use rich assertions of the terminal.

```ts
import { test, expect } from "@microsoft/tui-test";

test("make a regex assertion", async ({ terminal }) => {
  terminal.submit("ls -l")

  await expect(terminal.getByText(/total [0-9]{3}/g)).toBeVisible();
});
```

## Traces

TUI Test provides a rich tracing system to help you debug and diagnose issues with your tests. You can enable traces by setting the `trace` value in your `tui-test.config.ts` to `true` or by running the cli with the `-t/--trace` flag.

Traces are contain a replay of everything the terminal received and can be used to diagnose issues with your tests, especially when issues happen on different machines. Traces are stored in by default in the `tui-traces` folder in the root of your project and can be replayed via the `show-trace` command.

## Configuration

TUI Test can be configured via the `tui-test.config.[ts|js]` file in the root of your project. The following is an example of a configuration file:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@microsoft/tui-test";

export default defineConfig({
  retries: 3,
  trace: true
});

```
